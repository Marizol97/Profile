# Profile
Contains a picture of the mountains in the header, to represent SLC.
The about me section, on the right contains a quick bio description and contact information. The work section,
contains a section with work I've done. Such as code refactor, Fitness Plan, and a group project. Code refactor is self explanatory, I cleaned up the code without changing or crashing the website.
The fitness plan is a previous assignment I worked on, during my undergraduate degree. I created a workout plan for my friend Nia, and the group project is a quiz for stressed students. Students are presented with a quiz (that is only for interactive purposes, no data is collected) and when submitted they are shown pictures of dogs and quotes to help student distress.
