# Profile
Contains a picture of the mountains in the header, to represent SLC.
The about me section, on the right contains a quick bio description and contact information. The work section,
contains a section with work I've done. Such as code refactor, Fitness Plan, and Nail Art. Code refactor is self explanatory, I cleaned up the code without changing or crashing the website.
The fitness plan is a previous assignment I worked on, during my undergradte degree. I created a workout plan for my friend Nia, and Nail art is a social media account I created to channel my artistic side.
